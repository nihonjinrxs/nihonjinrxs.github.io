            "summary": "The attempt of this paper is to give an overview of previous research in the ﬁeld of sound and music synthesis using physical models of musical instruments and studies of the nonlinear dynamics of those models. Models considered are limited to those instruments producing sustained tones. Chua’s circuit, and its generalization, Chua’s oscillator, are described and detailed, including many of the dynamical phenomena associated with them. Musical concepts important to the models are discussed, as well as the time-delayed Chua’s circuit and its usefulness as a candidate for a synthesizing standard. Prospects for future research are also discussed."

Something of a polymath, he is well-versed in a variety of subjects and proficient at many activities: mathematics, computing, systems engineering, Japanese culture and history, music, and more. His intense engagement in the problem at hand and his tendency to dig for the broader or deeper view makes him invaluable in problem solving sessions. When brainstorming, Ryan's many and varied ideas ensure a divergent collection of potential solutions. He is a proficient speaker and communicates well in writing. He is able to craft his language to audiences from front line individuals to academics to top-level executives. As an added benefit, Ryan is fun to work with and sure to lighten the atmosphere during crunch times. I highly recommend him for his work.",

The program is designed to fill a gap in government information technology hiring by targeting the top IT schools in the country. Selected candidates are provided rotational leadership experiences throughout the Social Security Administration and have access to the Agency's upper-level executive leadership team. The candidates are selected based on their overall IT skills, ability to think differently and creatively about how to solve large-scale government information technology challenges, as well as demonstrate a commitment to service.\n\nActing as the #2 official for the Agency, I was on the selection committee that offered Ryan a Fellowship. Ryan exhibits all of these characteristics and is an excellent IT professional. We developed a professional relationship that continues to this day. While Ryan will surely excel in any career path he chooses, I personally hope he stays in public service. The government needs people like Ryan Harvey.",
