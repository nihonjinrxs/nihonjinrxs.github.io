                    I&#x27;m a fun-loving geek who is driven to create useful things (mostly with code) almost as much as I am called to teach others how to do it themselves. I enjoy diving into data and have been known to get lost in SQL at times. I&#x27;m passionate about clean, purposeful interfaces and joyous user experiences. I read lots of books, but never seem to get through my reading list. I&#x27;m a happy husband and father of two.

                              <p class="clear-margin">I gave a talk on the basics SQL and its utility for data preprocessing and analysis tasks to the Data Wrangers DC meetup group, a member meetup of the Data Community DC (http://datacommunitydc.org). The talk covered an introduction to relational data, database tools, and the SQL standard, as well as the basics of SQL select statements, common table expressions and creating views from select statements. In addition, the use of relevant libraries in R and Python to connect to data in relational databases were explained using examples with PostgreSQL, IPython notebooks, and RMarkdown.</p>

                              <p class="clear-margin">The attempt of this paper is to give an overview of previous research in the ﬁeld of sound and music synthesis using physical models of musical instruments and studies of the nonlinear dynamics of those models. Models considered are limited to those instruments producing sustained tones. Chua’s circuit, and its generalization, Chua’s oscillator, are described and detailed, including many of the dynamical phenomena associated with them. Musical concepts important to the models are discussed, as well as the time-delayed Chua’s circuit and its usefulness as a candidate for a synthesizing standard. Prospects for future research are also discussed.</p>

At the core of Kitchology is a series of database and ontology library that is used for connecting consumer activities. Because the usage models of this system is not set in stone, we need to architect the platform with the right level of flexibility and foresight for both use by consumer and operation by Kitchology. This is where Ryan shines.

Ryan brings a unique blend of engineering and architectural design for data-centric and algorithm-centric systems along real-life experience in deploying and operating systems.

Ryan is often the voice of reason when we make decisions that solve short term problems but might create problems in the long term. He does that for analytics, debugging process, design of database, choice of encoding mechanisms, interface to wireless systems, among others.

Ryan has a good insight for database complexity and architecture. He has a encycopledic knowledge of services and tools from third parties that should be used as a buy (rather than a make).

Ryan has tremendous work ethics, putting long hours to help move design and redesign along. He is willing to take on the dirty non glamorous tasks on behalf of others.</p>

                              <p class="clear-margin">Ryan is fundamentally curious, fiercely fastidious and resourceful in solving real, hard problems, managing talented teams, and building great software. He has a passion for bringing open source, big data and best-in-industry practices to bear on revolutionizing the tools that make the federal government work. His talents encompass architecting software, mentoring, translating user needs into features, and managing time and development resources to ship quality software.

Besides being extremely technically capable, Ryan is genuinely kind and warm human being. He is a pleasure to work for and knows how to inspire his team and allow them to build great things. His many and diverse interests - big data, Japanese, jazz, health, and advanced mathematics to name just a few - not only make him a fascinating and delightful person to talk to, but also inform his broad curiosity for and ability to solve hard business and technical problems.

I recommend Ryan strongly for the IT manager position of his choosing at the front lines of innovation in government, commercial software, or academia. He is a complete, all-around asset to any team fortunate to have him.</p>

It is no surprise that Ryan has a passion for education. He is always researching the latest tools as well as studying the historical trends of technology.

The Social Security Administration has less than 10 slots per year for the prestigious Hardy-Apfel IT Fellowship. The program is designed to fill a gap in government information technology hiring by targeting the top IT schools in the country. Selected candidates are provided rotational leadership experiences throughout the Social Security Administration and have access to the Agency&#x27;s upper-level executive leadership team. The candidates are selected based on their overall IT skills, ability to think differently and creatively about how to solve large-scale government information technology challenges, as well as demonstrate a commitment to service.

Acting as the #2 official for the Agency, I was on the selection committee that offered Ryan a Fellowship. Ryan exhibits all of these characteristics and is an excellent IT professional. We developed a professional relationship that continues to this day. While Ryan will surely excel in any career path he chooses, I personally hope he stays in public service. The government needs people like Ryan Harvey.</p>
